	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3>Q: Is there a textbook for this course?</h3>
	<p>A: No</p>
	<h3>Q: Are there teaching assistants (TAs) for this course?</h3>
	<p>A: No</p>
	<h3>Q: What are the differences between the online version and the classroom version of this course?</h3>
	<p>A: The only difference between the two versions is that the Capture The Flags game is played in teams in the
		classroom version of the course while it is played individually in the online version. Everything else is the
		same: content, labs, assessment, etc.</p>
	<h3>Q: What is the workload of this course?</h3>
	<p>A: Here is a list of all the labs with expected length and difficulty:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lab 1: Working with the Command Line, Short (1 hour max) to Long (3+ hours) --you can put in as much time as
			you want on this lab</li>
		<li>Lab 2: Packet Sleuth, Medium (1 - 3 hours)</li>
		<li>Lab 3: Scanning and Reconnaissance, Very short (30 minutes). <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly
				available because an actual target is used.</strong></li>
		<li>Lab 4: Python and the Incident Alarm, Long (over 3 hours) to Impossible</li>
		<li>Lab 5: The Password Cracking Contest, If you crack all the password hashes (read: good luck with that), you
			will receive an automatic "A" in the course</li>
		<li>Lab 6: The XSS Game, Short to Medium</li>
		<li>Lab 7: Gain Access to Website, Very short. <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because
				an actual target is used.</strong></li>
		<li>Lab 8: The CTF Game, A few days in group (classroom version of course) or one week individually (online
			version of course). <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because an actual target is
				used.</strong></li>
		<li>Lab 9: Technical Risk Analysis and Static Analysis, Short to Medium.</li>
		<li>Lab 10: Android Malware Analysis, Short to Medium</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Cybersecurity and Public Policy?</h3>
	<p>A: Yes</p>
	<h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Software Systems Development?</h3>
	<p>A: Yes. In fact, this is one of the four required courses for the M.S.</p>
	<h3>Q: Why is using a Kali virtual machine not mandatory for this class and thus strongly recommended?</h3>
	<p>A: The reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Accessibility. For students who are visually impaired, using a virtual machine can be very difficult.</li>
		<li>Not all students have a capable laptop. Sometimes due to financial reasons, some students use Chromebooks.
			The tools required for this course can be installed natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>
		<li>Performance. Sometimes, using a VM can be very slow. A VM also do not use native drivers (e.g., for
			networking).</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Q: Is Piazza used in this course?</h3>
	<p>Starting spring 2020, no. The reason: it is a nuisance for students to use multiple websites and services for one
		course. Because Canvas is used for labs and videos, we might as well use it for announcements and discussions.
	</p>
	<h3>Q: Why is there a course website and a course Canvas? If you said "it is a nuisance for students to use multiple
		websites and services for one course", what gives?</h3>
	<p>This course website serves a few critical purposes. Years ago, I made a decision to make all the readings, slide
		decks, and most of the labs publicly available. The reasons: (1) to show that Tufts is serious and is working on
		Cyber Security matters, (2) to provide learning material to the public on Cyber Security as the Cyber Security
		education problem is very dire, and (3) for recordkeeping on what is taught and not taught in this Security
		class --this comes up often when we speak to industry and organizations who want to work with Tufts on Cyber
		Security-related matters. The Canvas site for this course isn't made publicly available. Even if Canvas site was
		made publicly available, content is behind a walled garden.</p>
	<h3>Q: I have not taken a course on Networks (COMP 112), Operating Systems (COMP 111), or Computer Architecture
		(COMP 40) yet. Is that a problem?</h3>
	<p>No. Cyber Security is a very broad field and it is impossible for anyone, even professionals, to know everything.
		What is important for you is to start thinking about Security.</p>
	<h3>Q: If I am taking this course for professional purpose, can I have a tuition reimbursement letter or
		certificate?</h3>
	<p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/1085649884663828481" target="_blank">Absolutely! It's a nice
			tuition reimbursement letter, hand signed!</a></p>

	<h2 id="policy">Course Policies</h2>

	<h3>Student Accessibility Services (SAS)</h3>
	<p>If you have a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, please contact the Student Accessibility
		Services office at <a href="mailto:Accessibility@tufts.edu">Accessibility@tufts.edu</a> or 617-627-4539 to make
		an appointment with an SAS representative to determine appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that
		accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision. Please
		note that it is your responsibility to hand deliver accomodation letter to me.</p>

	<h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
	<p>Phones must be silent. You are allowed to politely step outside of the class to take phone calls (e.g., for
		emergencies, job offers).</p>

	<h3>Late Policy</h3>
	<p>We will grant an automatic extension of 24 hours to you at no cost (i.e., grace period). A lab submitted after
		the grace period will not be accepted.</p>
	<p>A lab is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally
		interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting the lab in on time, you have two options:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued three (3) "extension tokens." By expending
			an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single
			lab. To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent
			before the lab is due and not during the grace period. At most two extension tokens may be expended on any
			single lab. When you are out of tokens, late labs will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded,
			and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
		<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete the lab on time, your first step is to report the
			illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make
			suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other
			extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for
			undergraduate education. You must take this step before the lab is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or
			give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used. That is, you will not receive any special bonus at
		the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
