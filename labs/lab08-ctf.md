# Lab: The Capture The Flag Game 

## Objectives

1. Find vulnerabilities in web application(s) and then take advantage of them.

## Overview

In this traditional game in team of no more than 4 people, you will be finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a series of applications, mainly web, to gain access to information you should not have access to. The goal is to find the "flags" placed on the server or servers. As in the past, I will tell you how many flags I have planted. I will also an provide obscure hint for each of them.

## Instructions

The game starting IP address and URL: will be made available at 4:30 PM on Thursday, March 26th.

The scoreboard URL: will be made available at 4:30 PM on Thursday, March 26th.

## Logistics

* Team selection form will be open on Sunday, March 8th
* CTF teams will be determined by Thursday, March 12th
* Class will meet at Halligan 111A at 4:30 PM EST on Thursday, March 26th.  We will also have Halligan 118 reserved
* CTF game opens on on Thursday, March 26th at 4:30 PM EST
* Points submitted after 10 AM on Friday, March 27th are worth 1/2 value.  This is subject to change.
* CTF game closes on Saturday, March 28th at 5:00 PM EST
* CTF write-up due on Wednesday, April 1st at 11:59 PM EST, one submission per team via email.

## A Flag

In the style of many Security Capture The Flag games, the format of a flag will look like this: `key{flag}`. Examples: `key{somelongstringthatrepresentshteflag}` or `key{334359b051f4dda20937055605b3706dfe91d6c8}`. Each flag will worth a certain value: 100 points, 200 points, 300, and 400 points. Your team will be given a unique key to submit flags on the day of the game.

## Scoring

There will be a scoreboard. The scoreboard will display a hint for each flag, and the scores for each player.  This is also where you will submit flags.  The scoreboard is available at TBD. WARNING: use of a previous CTF game flag will result in -400 points!

## Assessment

There will be two components for grading:

1. Your team's score for the game (15 points)
2. Your team's CTF writeup (15 points)

## Ground Rules

1. Should you tamper with the scoreboard or flag submission system, 100 points will be deducted from your score for each attempt.

## Preparing to Play

* It is important that you tinker with the applications.
* Use your creativity. That is, if you were an attacker, what would do?
* Be sure to view the source of all the web pages and relevant files.
* For some challenges (flags), some programming or scripting may be necessary.
* Resources that would be ideal to have for the game: SQL reference, a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite, TamperData for Firefox), Kali or BackTrack Live CD. You are encouraged to use tools that are on Kali Linux.

## The CTF Write-Up

Each team will produce a write-up that submitted electronically in PDF format by Wednesday, April 1st at 11:59 PM EST. Designate one team member of the team to submit PDF via email to mchow AT cs DOT tufts DOT edu.

So what constitutes a good CTF write-up? For each flag that your team finds, the following information should be provided:

* A screenshot of the flag
* The exact location of the flag (path or file name)
* The exploit or methodology used to find the flag

A good example of a CTF write-up is https://s0cket7.com/picoctf-web/ (2018 game). A list of CTF write-ups can be found at https://ctftime.org/writeups and at https://github.com/VulnHub/ctf-writeups.
